## 1. What is a Notification in Android?
   Answer: A notification is a message that Android displays outside of your app's normal UI to provide the user with reminders, updates, or other timely information. Notifications appear in the notification drawer and can also appear on the lock screen.

## 2. How Do You Create a Basic Notification?
   Answer: To create a basic notification, use the NotificationCompat.Builder class. Here’s an example:

```kotlin
val notificationBuilder = NotificationCompat.Builder(this, CHANNEL_ID)
.setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_icon)
.setContentTitle("Notification Title")
.setContentText("This is the content of the notification")
.setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_DEFAULT)

with(NotificationManagerCompat.from(this)) {
notify(NOTIFICATION_ID, notificationBuilder.build())
}
```

## 3. What is a Notification Channel and Why is it Important?
   Answer: Notification channels are used to group notifications of the same type together and to provide users with control over notification settings for each channel. From Android 8.0 (API level 26) onwards, you must create a notification channel to send notifications. Each channel has its own settings for importance, sound, vibration, etc.

Example:

kotlin
```kotlin
if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O) {
val channel = NotificationChannel(
CHANNEL_ID,
"Channel Name",
NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT
).apply {
description = "Channel description"
}

    val notificationManager: NotificationManager =
        getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE) as NotificationManager

    notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(channel)
}
```
## 4. How Do You Handle User Interaction with Notifications?
   Answer: You can handle user interaction by setting a PendingIntent to be triggered when the user taps the notification. This can start an Activity, a BroadcastReceiver, or a Service.

Example:

```kotlin
val intent = Intent(this, YourActivity::class.java).apply {
flags = Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK or Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK
}

val pendingIntent: PendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, intent, 0)

val notificationBuilder = NotificationCompat.Builder(this, CHANNEL_ID)
.setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_icon)
.setContentTitle("Notification Title")
.setContentText("Tap to open activity")
.setContentIntent(pendingIntent)
.setAutoCancel(true)
```

## 5. What Are the Different Notification Priorities and How Do They Affect Notifications?
   Answer: Notification priority levels determine how notifications are presented to the user:

PRIORITY_HIGH: Notifications are shown prominently and may interrupt the user.
PRIORITY_DEFAULT: Notifications are shown in the normal way.
PRIORITY_LOW: Notifications are minimized and appear in a less intrusive manner.
PRIORITY_MIN: Notifications are shown only in the notification drawer and have no visual interruption.
Example:

```kotlin
.setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_HIGH)
```

## 6. How Do You Create a Notification with Custom Layouts?
   Answer: You can use custom layouts to make your notifications more visually appealing by using the RemoteViews class.

Example:

```kotlin
val customView = RemoteViews(packageName, R.layout.custom_notification_layout)

val notificationBuilder = NotificationCompat.Builder(this, CHANNEL_ID)
.setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_icon)
.setCustomContentView(customView)
``` 

## 7. What Are Notification Actions and How Do You Add Them?
   Answer: Notification actions are buttons that the user can tap to perform an action directly from the notification. You can add actions using addAction() on the NotificationCompat.Builder.

```kotlin
val actionIntent = Intent(this, YourBroadcastReceiver::class.java)
val actionPendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, actionIntent, 0)

val notificationBuilder = NotificationCompat.Builder(this, CHANNEL_ID)
.setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_icon)
.setContentTitle("Notification Title")
.setContentText("This notification has actions")
.addAction(R.drawable.action_icon, "Action Title", actionPendingIntent)
```

## 8. What Is the Difference Between a Notification and a Toast?
   Answer: A notification is a message that appears outside the app’s UI and can be persistent or ongoing, whereas a toast is a short, transient message that appears within the app's UI and disappears after a short time. Notifications are used for longer or more important messages, while toasts are for brief, non-intrusive notifications.

## 9. How Do You Handle Notification Groups?
   Answer: Notification groups allow you to group multiple notifications together, making it easier for users to manage related notifications.

Example:

```kotlin
val groupKey = "com.example.GROUP_KEY"

val notificationBuilder = NotificationCompat.Builder(this, CHANNEL_ID)
.setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_icon)
.setContentTitle("Group Notification Title")
.setContentText("This is a group notification")
.setGroup(groupKey)

val summaryBuilder = NotificationCompat.Builder(this, CHANNEL_ID)
.setContentTitle("Group Summary")
.setContentText("Summary of group notifications")
.setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_icon)
.setGroup(groupKey)
.setGroupSummary(true)

NotificationManagerCompat.from(this).apply {
notify(NOTIFICATION_ID, notificationBuilder.build())
notify(SUMMARY_ID, summaryBuilder.build())
}
```

## 10. How Do You Handle Notification Channels for Different Android Versions?
    Answer: On Android 8.0 (Oreo) and above, you must create notification channels to send notifications. For earlier versions, you can send notifications directly without channels.

Example:

kotlin
Copy code
if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O) {
val channel = NotificationChannel(
CHANNEL_ID,
"Channel Name",
NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT
).apply {
description = "Channel description"
}

    val notificationManager: NotificationManager =
        getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE) as NotificationManager

    notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(channel)
}
